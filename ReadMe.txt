Instructions to run the test script:
____________________________________

Step 1: Make sure latest version of Java (I have used Java 15) installed in your machine

Step 2: Make sure Eclipse IDE is available

Step 3: Import the given project to the workspace and make sure it is no error on the pom.xml. Please save the without change anything.

Step4: If you are using Mac system then I request you to enable the access to record the content for Eclipse on “Security and Privacy” settings (we need this setting for screenshot)

Step 5: Open the “WestwingTask2_Lakshmanan” project on Eclipse, navigate to “src/test/java” folder and expand “westwingAutomation” package and click the “Tast2.java” file. Provide the user email address on the line 61 and provide the user password on line 62 and do save the changes.

Step 6: Right click on the “testing.xml” file which is available on the “WestwingTask2_Lakshmanan” project and select “Run As” option and click “TestNG Suite”

Note: Please do the step 6 one more time if it is stopped due to timeout (have provided 10 seconds internally on explicit wait)

Step 7: After execution I request you to open the “ExtentReport.html” file under project path >> Output >> Report folder and see the screenshots under project path >> Output >> Screenshots folder.
